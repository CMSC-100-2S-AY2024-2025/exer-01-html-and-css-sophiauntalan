                <h1>Hello, there! I am Sophia Untalan.</h1>
                <p>UPLB Student | Web Programmer | Python Developer</p>
                <p class="greeting">
                    I am a graduating Computer Science student with a strong passion for frontend development and software engineering. My expertise includes Python, HTML, and CSS, and I also have experience working with C, Java, and R. With a solid technical foundation and a keen eye for design, I strive to build efficient, user-friendly web applications that enhance user experiences. I work well in collaborative environments, valuing teamwork and clear communication to ensure smooth coordination in fast-paced projects.
                    <br><br>
                    Beyond coding, I have a diverse range of interests that have helped shape me into a well-rounded individual. As a varsity futsal athlete, I have developed discipline, resilience, and teamwork, while my participation in pageants and fashion shows has strengthened my confidence and adaptability. These experiences allow me to connect easily with people and take instructions effectively. I am eager to apply for the Frontend Software Engineer position at Gugil Co. because I am passionate about building seamless, interactive user interfaces and believe my skills and experiences will allow me to contribute meaningfully to innovative projects.
